              <big>W</big>ELCOME TO the Eighth Edition of <i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i>, a free, on-line textbook on introductory programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful
              for experienced programmers who want to learn something about Java. It is not meant to provide complete coverage of the Java language.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eighth edition requires Java 8 or later, and it uses JavaFX for GUI programming. Version&nbsp;8.1.3 is a small update of Version&nbsp;8.0. This version briefly covers some of the new features added to Java after Java&nbsp;8, and it makes it clearer how to use this book with
              Java&nbsp;11 and later. Earlier editions of the book are still available. See the <a href="preface.html">preface</a> for links to older editions.
            </p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These should be considered experimental. Depending on the particular ebook reader that you use, there can be problems with rendering of long lines in program code sample. You might find that lines that are too long to fit across your screen are
                    incorrectly split into multiple lines, or that the part that extends beyond the right margin is simply dropped. On some readers, you might be able to scroll horizontally to see the hidden text. The ebooks include answers to quizzes and exercises but do not include source code for
                    sample programs; the sample programs can be downloaded separately, above.
