          <span class="start"><big>A</big>s computers and their user interfaces</span> have become easier to use, they have also become more complex for programmers to deal with. You can write programs for a simple console-style user interface using just a few subroutines that write output to the
          console and read the user's typed replies. A modern graphical user interface, with windows, buttons, scroll bars, menus, text-input boxes, and so on, might make things easier for the user, but it forces the programmer to cope with a hugely expanded array of possibilities. The programmer
          sees this increased complexity in the form of great numbers of subroutines that are provided for managing the user interface, as well as for other purposes.

          <a name="subroutines.5.1">4.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Toolboxes</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Someone who wanted to program for the original Macintosh computers&mdash;and to produce programs that look and behave the way users expected them to&mdash;had to deal with the "Macintosh Toolbox," a collection of well over a thousand different subroutines. There were routines for opening
          and closing windows, for drawing geometric figures and text to windows, for adding buttons to windows, and for responding to mouse clicks on the window. There were other routines for creating menus and for reacting to user selections from menus. Aside from the user interface, there were
          routines for opening files and reading data from them, for communicating over a network, for sending output to a printer, for handling communication between programs, and in general for doing all the standard things that a computer has to do. Microsoft Windows provides its own set of
          subroutines for programmers to use, and they are quite a bit different from the subroutines used on the Mac. Linux has several different GUI toolboxes for the programmer to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The analogy of a "toolbox" is a good one to keep in mind. Every programming project involves a mixture of innovation and reuse of existing tools. A programmer is given a set of tools to work with, starting with the set of basic tools that are built into the language: things like variables,
          assignment statements, if statements, and loops. To these, the programmer can add existing toolboxes full of routines that have already been written for performing certain tasks. These tools, if they are well-designed, can be used as true black boxes: They can be called to perform their
          assigned tasks without worrying about the particular steps they go through to accomplish those tasks. The innovative part of programming is to take all these tools and apply them to some particular project or problem (word-processing, keeping track of bank accounts, processing image data
          from a space probe, Web browsing, computer games,&nbsp;...). This is called <span class="newword">applications programming</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A software toolbox is a kind of black box, and it presents a certain interface to the programmer. This interface is a specification of what routines are in the toolbox, what parameters they use, and what tasks they perform. This information constitutes the <span class="newword">API</span>,
          or <span class="newword">Application Programming Interface</span>, associated with the toolbox. The Macintosh API is a specification of all the routines available in the Macintosh Toolbox. A company that makes some hardware device&mdash;say a card for connecting a computer to a
          network&mdash;might publish an API for that device consisting of a list of routines that programmers can call in order to communicate with and control the device. Scientists who write a set of routines for doing some kind of complex computation&mdash;such as solving "differential
          equations," say&mdash;would provide an API to allow others to use those routines without understanding the details of the computations they perform.
        </p>

        <hr class="break" />

        <p>
          The Java programming language is supplemented by a large, standard API. You've seen part of this API already, in the form of mathematical subroutines such as <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span>, the <span class="classname">String</span> data type and its associated routines, and the
          <span class="code">System.out.print()</span> routines. The standard Java API includes routines for working with graphical user interfaces, for network communication, for reading and writing files, and more. It's tempting to think of these routines as being part of the Java language, but
          they are technically subroutines that have been written and made available for use in Java programs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java is platform-independent. That is, the same program can run on platforms as diverse as Mac&nbsp;OS, Windows, Linux, and others. The same Java API must work on all these platforms. But notice that it is the <b>interface</b> that is platform-independent; the <b>implementation</b> of some
          parts of the API varies from one platform to another. A Java system on a particular computer includes implementations of all the standard API routines. A Java program includes only <b>calls</b> to those routines. When the Java interpreter executes a program and encounters a call to one of
          the standard routines, it will pull up and execute the implementation of that routine which is appropriate for the particular platform on which it is running. This is a very powerful idea. It means that you only need to learn one API to program for a wide variety of platforms.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection_title">
          <a name="subroutines.5.2">4.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Java's Standard Packages</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Like all subroutines in Java, the routines in the standard API are grouped into classes. To provide larger-scale organization, classes in Java can be grouped into <span class="newword">packages</span>, which were introduced briefly in
          <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.7</a>. You can have even higher levels of grouping, since packages can also contain other packages. In fact, the entire standard Java API is implemented in several packages. One of these, which is named "<span class="code">java</span
          >", contains several non-GUI packages as well as the original AWT graphical user interface classes. Another package, "<span class="code">javax</span>", contains the classes used by the Swing graphical user interface as well as many other classes. And "<span class="code">javafx</span>"
          contains the JavaFX API that is used for GUI programming in this textbook.
        </p>

        <p>
          A package can contain both classes and other packages. A package that is contained in another package is sometimes called a "sub-package." Both the <span class="code">java</span> package and the <span class="code">javafx</span> package contain sub-packages. One of the sub-packages of
          <span class="code">java</span>, for example, is named "<span class="code">util</span>". Since <span class="code">util</span> is contained within <span class="code">java</span>, its full name is actually <span class="code">java.util</span>. This package contains a variety of utility
          classes, including the <span class="classname">Scanner</span> class that was discussed in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.6</a>. The <span class="code">java</span> package includes several other sub-packages, such as <span class="code">java.io</span>, which provides
          facilities for input/output, and <span class="code">java.net</span>, which deals with network communication. The most basic package is called <span class="code">java.lang</span>. This package contains fundamental classes such as <span class="classname">String</span>,
          <span class="classname">Math</span>, <span class="classname">Integer</span>, and <span class="classname">Double</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It might be helpful to look at a graphical representation of the levels of nesting in the <span class="code">java</span> package, its sub-packages, the classes in those sub-packages, and the subroutines in those classes. This is not a complete picture, since it shows only a very few of the
          many items in each element:
        </p>

        <p align="center">
          <img src="package-class-subroutine.png" width="524" height="350" alt="(Diagram of subroutine/class/package nesting)" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, the package <span class="code">javafx</span> contains a package <span class="code">javafx.scene</span>, which in turn contains <span class="code">javafx.scene.control</span>. This package contains classes that represent GUI components such as buttons and input boxes. Another
          subpackage, <span class="code">javafx.scene.paint</span>, contains class <span class="classname">Color</span> and other classes that define ways to fill and stroke a shape.
        </p>

        <p>
          The standard Java API includes thousands of classes in hundreds of packages. Many of the classes are rather obscure or very specialized, but you might want to browse through the documentation to see what is available. As I write this, the documentation for the complete basic API for
          Java&nbsp;8 can be found at

          See the subsection about "modules," below, for a discussion of changes that were made the language in Java&nbsp;9 and for links to the documentation for Java&nbsp;11. However, for the purposes of this textbook, you will probably find that the Java&nbsp;8 documentation is easier to use.
        </p>

        <p>Even an expert programmer won't be familiar with the entire Java API, or even a majority of it. In this book, you'll only encounter several dozen classes, and those will be sufficient for writing a wide variety of programs.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection_title">
          <a name="subroutines.5.3">4.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Classes from Packages</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Let's say that you want to use the class <span class="code">javafx.scene.paint.Color</span> in a program that you are writing. This is the full name of class <span class="classname">Color</span> in package <span class="code">javafx.scene.paint</span>. Like any class,
          <span class="code">javafx.scene.paint.Color</span> is a type, which means that you can use it to declare variables and parameters and to specify the return type of a function. One way to do this is to use the full name of the class as the name of the type. For example, suppose that you
          want to declare a variable named <span class="code">rectColor</span> of type <span class="classname">Color</span>. You could say:
        </p>

        <pre>javafx.scene.paint.Color  rectColor;</pre>

        <p>
          This is just an ordinary variable declaration of the form "<span class="bnf">type-name</span>&nbsp;<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>;". Of course, using the full name of every class can get tiresome, and you will hardly ever see full names like this used in a program. Java makes it
          possible to avoid using the full name of a class by <span class="newword">importing</span> the class. If you put
        </p>

        <pre>import javafx.scene.paint.Color;</pre>

        <p>
          at the beginning of a Java source code file, then, in the rest of the file, you can abbreviate the full name <span class="code">javafx.scene.paint.Color</span> to just the simple name of the class, which is <span class="code">Color</span>. Note that the
          <span class="code">import</span> line comes at the start of a file (after the <span class="code">package</span> statement, if there is one) and is not inside any class. Although it is sometimes referred to as a statement, it is more properly called an
          <span class="newword">import&nbsp;directive</span> since it is not a statement in the usual sense. The <span class="code">import</span> directive "<span class="code">import&nbsp;javafx.scene.paint.Color</span>" would allow you to say
        </p>

        <pre>Color  rectColor;</pre>

        <p>
          to declare the variable. Note that the only effect of the <span class="code">import</span> directive is to allow you to use simple class names instead of full "package.class" names. You aren't really importing anything substantial; if you leave out the
          <span class="code">import</span> directive, you can still access the class&mdash;you just have to use its full name. There is a shortcut for importing all the classes from a given package. For example, you can import all the classes from <span class="code">java.util</span> by saying
        </p>

        <pre>import java.util.*;</pre>

        <p>
          The "<span class="code">*</span>" is a <span class="newword">wildcard</span> that matches every class in the package. (However, it does not match sub-packages; for example, you <b>cannot</b> import the entire contents of all the sub-packages of the <span class="code">javafx</span> package
          by saying <span class="code">import&nbsp;javafx.*</span>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Some programmers think that using a wildcard in an <span class="code">import</span> statement is bad style, since it can make a large number of class names available that you are not going to use and might not even know about. They think it is better to explicitly import each individual
          class that you want to use. In my own programming, I often use wildcards to import all the classes from the most relevant packages, and use individual imports when I am using just one or two classes from a given package.
        </p>

        <p>
          A program that works with networking might include the line "<span class="code">import java.net.*;</span>", while one that reads or writes files might use "<span class="code">import java.io.*;</span>". But when you start importing lots of packages in this way, you have to be careful about
          one thing: It's possible for two classes that are in different packages to have the same name. For example, both the <span class="code">java.awt</span> package and the <span class="code">java.util</span> package contain a class named <span class="code">List</span>. If you import both
          <span class="code">java.awt.*</span> and <span class="code">java.util.*</span>, the simple name <span class="code">List</span> will be ambiguous. If you try to declare a variable of type <span class="code">List</span>, you will get a compiler error message about an ambiguous class name.
          You can still use both classes in your program: Use the full name of the class, either <span class="code">java.awt.List</span> or <span class="code">java.util.List</span>. Another solution, of course, is to use <span class="code">import</span> to import the individual classes you need,
          instead of importing entire packages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the package <span class="code">java.lang</span> is so fundamental, all the classes in <span class="code">java.lang</span> are <b>automatically</b> imported into every program. It's as if every program began with the statement "<span class="code">import java.lang.*;</span>". This is
          why we have been able to use the class name <span class="classname">String</span> instead of <span class="code">java.lang.String</span>, and <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span> instead of <span class="code">java.lang.Math.sqrt()</span>. It would still, however, be perfectly legal to use
          the longer forms of the names.
        </p>

        <p>Programmers can create new packages. Suppose that you want some classes that you are writing to be in a package named <span class="code">utilities</span>. Then the source code files that defines those classes must begin with the line</p>

        <pre>package utilities;</pre>

        <p>
          This would come even before any <span class="code">import</span> directive in that file. Furthermore, the source code file would be placed in a folder with the same name as the package, "utilities" in this example. And a class that is in a subpackage must be in a subfolder. For example, a
          class in a package named <span class="code">utilities.net</span> would be in folder named "net" inside a folder named "utilities". A class that is in a package automatically has access to other classes in the same package; that is, a class doesn't have to import classes from the package in
          which it is defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          In projects that define large numbers of classes, it makes sense to organize those classes into packages. It also makes sense for programmers to create new packages as toolboxes that provide functionality and APIs for dealing with areas not covered in the standard Java API. (And in fact
          such "toolmaking" programmers often have more prestige than the applications programmers who use their tools.)
        </p>

        <p>
          However, with just a couple of exceptions such as class <span class="classname">TextIO</span> in package <span class="code">textio</span>, the classes written for this book are not in packages. For the purposes of this book, you need to know about packages mainly so that you will be able
          to import <span class="classname">TextIO</span> and classes from the standard packages. The standard packages are always available to the programs that you write. You might wonder where the standard classes are actually located. Again, that can depend to some extent on the version of Java
          that you are using. In Java&nbsp;8 they are stored in <span class="newword">jar files</span> in a subdirectory named <i>lib</i> inside the Java Runtime Environment installation directory. A&nbsp;.jar (or "Java archive") file is a single file that can contain many classes. Most of the
          classes used with Java&nbsp;8 can be found in a jar file named <span class="code">rt.jar</span>. Things changed substantially in Java&nbsp;9, as discussed in the next subsection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although we won't be creating packages explicitly, <b>every</b> class is actually part of a package. If a class is not specifically placed in a package, then it is put in something called the <span class="newword">default package</span>, which has no name. Almost all the examples that you
          see in this book are in the default package.
        </p>

        <hr class="break" />
        <h3 class="subsection_title">
          <a name="subroutines.5.3a">4.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;About Modules</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Starting with Java&nbsp;9, a major change was made to the large-scale structure of Java with the introduction of <span class="newword">modules</span>. A module is a collection of packages, so it represents yet another level of containment: Modules contain packages which contain classes
          which contain variables and methods. A package does not have to be in a module to be used, but all of the standard classes in Java and in JavaFX have been divided into a set of modules.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modules were introduced for several reasons. A major reason is to provide better access control. Before modules, a class that is declared <span class="code">public</span>
          can be used anywhere, from any class in any package, as can its public variables and methods. For a class that is defined in a module, on the other hand, "public" only automatically means public within the module where it is defined. However, a module can explicitly
          <span class="newword">export</span> a package. Exporting a package from a module makes the public classes in the package accessible from anywhere, including from other modules and from classes that are not part of any module. (It is even possible to export a package just to certain
          specified modules, providing an even finer level of access control.) The upshot is that it is now possible to have entire packages that are essentially private: They provide services to other packages in the same module, but are invisible from outside that module. So a module is another
          kind of black box, and a non-exported package is part of its hidden implementation. Of course, modularity on this scale is really only important for very large-scale applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another motivation for modules is the sheer size of the standard JRE (Java Runtime Environment), which includes all of the standard classes. A given application will use only a small part of the standard runtime. Modularization makes it possible to construct smaller, custom JREs that
          contain only the modules that are required by an application. The JDK includes a <i>jlink</i> command for making custom runtimes, which can include modules that define an application as well as the standard modules that are required to run that application. That runtime can then be
          distributed as a standalone application that can be executed even by people who have not installed a JDK on their computer. But just as for the JDK itself, different versions of the custom runtime will be needed for Windows, for Mac&nbsp;OS, and for Linux. Furthermore, when security
          updates are made to the JDK, they are not automatically applied to custom runtimes, so the application developer takes on the responsibility of updating custom runtimes. Once again, this is really only useful for fairly large applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a JDK for Java&nbsp;9 or later, compiled class files from the standard modules are stored together in a file named <i>modules</i> inside a directory named <i>lib</i> in the main JDK directory. This is a so-called "jimage file," and there is a command-line tool named <i>jimage</i> for
          working with such files. If you use the <i>jlink</i> tool to create a custom runtime, part of what it does is to create a custom <i>modules</i> file containing just the modules that are needed by the runtime. In the JDK&nbsp;12 on my Linux computer, <i>modules</i> is a 130 megabyte file
          containing 30199 classes in 1000 packages in 70 modules. The JDK directory also has a subdirectory named <i>jmods</i> that contains the modules in another form. However, it is not required for compiling and running programs and, as far as I can tell, is meant mostly for use by
          <i>jlink</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modules in the JDK include, for example, <i>java.base</i> (which contains the basic modules such as <span class="code">java.lang</span> and <span class="code">java.util</span>) and <span class="code">java.desktop</span>
          (which include packages for the Swing GUI toolkit). JavaFX packages include
          <i>javafx.base</i>, <i>javafx.control</i>, <i>javafx.graphics</i>, and a few that are less generally useful. The API documentation for modular versions of Java is divided into modules, then into packages, and finally into classes. This makes the documentation harder to browse than in older
          versions of Java. However, the documentation web site does have an effective search feature. As I write this, the documentation for Java&nbsp;11 and for JavaFX&nbsp;11 is available at:

          A class can be defined outside of any module, and it is possible for that class to use packages from modules, provided that those packages are exported by the modules where they are defined. In particular, a programmer can use classes from the JDK without ever thinking about modules or
          knowing that they exist. This applies to all the command-line programs in this book. However, when using Java&nbsp;11 or later, things are different for GUI programs that use JavaFX, which has been removed from the JDK and is distributed as a separate set of modules. As we saw in
          <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>, when you compile or run a JavaFX program, you need to specify a module path that includes the JavaFX modules, and you need to provide an <span class="code">--add-modules</span> option. (In <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>, the value
          for <span class="code">--add-modules</span> was given as <span class="code">ALL-MODULE-PATH</span>, which lets the program access any modules that are found on the module path. An alternative is to specify a list of names of just those modules that are actually used by the program.)
        </p>

        <p>Aside from using modules with JavaFX and the basic background information in this section, this textbook does not cover modules.</p>

          <a name="subroutines.5.4">4.6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Javadoc</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          To use an API effectively, you need good documentation for it. The documentation for most Java APIs is prepared using a system called <span class="newword">Javadoc</span>. For example, this system is used to prepare the documentation for Java's standard packages. And almost everyone who
          creates a toolbox in Java publishes Javadoc documentation for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Javadoc documentation is prepared from special comments that are placed in the Java source code file. Recall that one type of Java comment begins with <span class="code">/*</span> and ends with&nbsp;<span class="code">*/</span>. A Javadoc comment takes the same form, but it begins with
          <span class="code">/**</span> rather than simply&nbsp;<span class="code">/*</span>. You have already seen comments of this form in many of the examples in this book.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that a Javadoc comment must be placed just <b>before</b> the subroutine that it is commenting on. This rule is always followed. You can have Javadoc comments for subroutines, for member variables, and for classes. The Javadoc comment always <b>immediately precedes</b> the thing it is
          commenting on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like any comment, a Javadoc comment is ignored by the computer when the file is compiled. But there is a tool called <span class="code">javadoc</span> that reads Java source code files, extracts any Javadoc comments that it finds, and creates a set of Web pages containing the comments in a
          nicely formatted, interlinked form. By default, <span class="code">javadoc</span> will only collect information about <span class="code">public</span> classes, subroutines, and member variables, but it allows the option of creating documentation for non-public things as well. If
          <span class="code">javadoc</span> doesn't find any Javadoc comment for something, it will construct one, but the comment will contain only basic information such as the name and type of a member variable or the name, return type, and parameter list of a subroutine. This is
          <b>syntactic</b> information. To add information about semantics and pragmatics, you have to write a Javadoc comment.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example, you can look at the documentation Web page for <span class="classname">TextIO</span> by following this link: <a href="../TextIO_Javadoc/index.html">TextIO&nbsp;Javadoc&nbsp;documentation</a>. The documentation page was created by applying the
          <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool to the source code file, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter4/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span
          >. If you have downloaded the on-line version of this book, the documentation can be found in the <span class="code">TextIO_Javadoc</span> directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a Javadoc comment, the <span class="code">*</span>'s at the start of each line are optional. The <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool will remove them. In addition to normal text, the comment can contain certain special codes. For one thing, the comment can contain
          <span class="newword">HTML mark-up</span> commands. HTML is the language that is used to create web pages, and Javadoc comments are meant to be shown on web pages. The <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool will copy any HTML commands in the comments to the web pages that it creates. The
          book will not teach you HTML, but as an example, you can add <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> to indicate the start of a new paragraph. (Generally, in the absence of HTML commands, blank lines and extra spaces in the comment are ignored. Furthermore, the characters &amp; and &lt; have
          special meaning in HTML and should not be used in Javadoc comments except with those meanings; they can be written as <span class="code">&amp;amp;</span> and&nbsp;<span class="code">&amp;lt;</span>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to HTML commands, Javadoc comments can include <span class="newword">doc tags</span>, which are processed as commands by the <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool. A doc tag has a name that begins with the character&nbsp;<span class="code">@</span>. I will only discuss four
          tags: <span class="code">@author</span>, <span class="code">@param</span>, <span class="code">@return</span>, and <span class="code">@throws</span>. The <span class="code">@author</span> tag can be used only for a class, and should be followed by the name of the author. The other three
          tags are used in Javadoc comments for a subroutine to provide information about its parameters, its return value, and the exceptions that it might throw. These tags <b>must</b> be placed at the end of the comment, after any description of the subroutine itself. The syntax for using them
          is:
        </p>

        <pre>@param  <span class="bnf">parameter-name</span>   <span class="bnf">description-of-parameter</span>
   
@return  <span class="bnf">description-of-return-value</span>
   
@throws  <span class="bnf">exception-class-name</span>   <span class="bnf">description-of-exception</span>
</pre>

        <p>
          The <span class="bnf">descriptions</span> can extend over several lines. The description ends at the next doc tag or at the end of the comment. You can include a <span class="code">@param</span> tag for every parameter of the subroutine and a <span class="code">@throws</span> for as many
          types of exception as you want to document. You should have a <span class="code">@return</span> tag only for a non-void subroutine. These tags do not have to be given in any particular order.
        </p>

        <p>Here is an example that doesn't do anything exciting but that does use all three types of doc tag:</p>

        <pre>
/**
 * This subroutine computes the area of a rectangle, given its width
 * and its height.  The length and the width should be positive numbers.
 * @param width the length of one side of the rectangle
 * @param height the length the second side of the rectangle
 * @return the area of the rectangle
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either the width or the height
 *    is a negative number.
 */
public static double areaOfRectangle( double length, double width ) {
    if ( width &lt; 0  ||  height &lt; 0 )
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sides must have positive length.");
    double area;
    area = width * height;
    return area; 
}</pre
        >

        <p>I use Javadoc comments for many of my examples. I encourage you to use them in your own code, even if you don't plan to generate Web page documentation of your work, since it's a standard format that other Java programmers will be familiar with.</p>

        <p>
          If you do want to create Web-page documentation, you need to run the <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool. This tool is available as a command in the Java Development Kit that was discussed in <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>. You can use the
          <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool in a command line interface similarly to the way that the <span class="code">javac</span> and <span class="code">java</span> commands are used. Javadoc can also be applied in the integrated development environments that were also discussed in
          <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>. I won't go into any of the details here; consult the documentation for your programming environment.

          <a name="subroutines.5.5">4.6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Static Import</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Before ending this section, I will mention an extension of the <span class="code">import</span> directive. We have seen that <span class="code">import</span> makes it possible to refer to a class such as <span class="code">java.util.Scanner</span> using its simple name,
          <span class="classname">Scanner</span>. But you still have to use compound names to refer to static member variables such as <span class="code">System.out</span> and to static methods such as <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is another form of the <span class="code">import</span> directive that can be used to import <span class="code">static</span> members of a class in the same way that the ordinary <span class="code">import</span> directive imports classes from a package. That form of the directive is
          called a <span class="newword">static import</span>, and it has syntax
        </p>

        <pre>import static <span class="bnf">package-name</span>.<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">static-member-name</span>;</pre>

        <p>to import one static member name from a class, or</p>

        <pre>import static <span class="bnf">package-name</span>.<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.*;</pre>

        <p>to import all the public static members from a class. For example, if you preface a class definition with</p>

        <pre>import static java.lang.System.out;</pre>

        <p>
          then you can use the simple name <span class="code">out</span> instead of the compound name <span class="code">System.out</span>. This means you can say <span class="code">out.println</span> instead of <span class="code">System.out.println</span>. If you are going to work extensively with
          the <span class="classname">Math</span> class, you might preface your class definition with
        </p>

        <pre>import static java.lang.Math.*;</pre>

        <p>
          This would allow you to say <span class="code">sqrt</span> instead of <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>, <span class="code">log</span> instead of <span class="code">Math.log</span>, <span class="code">PI</span> instead of <span class="code">Math.PI</span>, and so on. And you could import
          the <i>getlnInt</i> function from <span class="classname">TextIO</span> using
        </p>

        <pre>import static textio.TextIO.getlnInt;</pre>

        <p>Note that the static import directive requires a <span class="bnf">package-name</span>, even for classes in the standard package <span class="code">java.lang</span>. One consequence of this is that you can't do a static import from a class in the default package.</p>
