        <p>
          <span class="start"><big>I</big>n the classic programming model,</span> there is a single central processing unit that reads instructions from memory and carries them out, one after the other. The purpose of a program is to provide the list of instructions for the processor to execute.
          This is the only type of programming that we have considered so far.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this model of programming has limitations. Modern computers have multiple processors, making it possible for them to perform several tasks at the same time. To use the full potential of all those processors, you will need to write programs that can do
          <span class="newword">parallel processing</span>. For Java programmers, that means learning about <span class="newword">threads</span>. A single thread is similar to the programs that you have been writing up until now, but more than one thread can be running at the same time, "in
          parallel." What makes things more interesting&mdash;and more difficult&mdash;than single-threaded programming is the fact that the threads in a parallel program are rarely completely independent of one another. They usually need to cooperate and communicate. Learning to manage and control
          cooperation among threads is the main hurdle that you will face in this chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are several reasons to use parallel programming. One is simply to do computations more quickly by setting several processors to work on them simultaneously. Just as important, however, is to use threads to deal with "blocking" operations, where a process can't proceed until some
          event occurs. In the <a href="../c11/index.html">previous chapter</a>, for example, we saw how programs can block while waiting for data to arrive over a network connection. Threads make it possible for one part of a program to continue to do useful work even while another part is blocked,
          waiting for some event to occur. In this context, threads are a vital programming tool even for a computer that has only a single processing unit.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Java has developed, new features have been added to the language that make it possible to do parallel programming without using threads directly. We have already seen one of these: parallel streams in the stream API from <a href="../c10/s6.html">Section&nbsp;10.6</a>. We will encounter
          several more in this chapter. But to use these higher level language features safely and efficiently, you still need to know something about the hazards and benefits of threads.
