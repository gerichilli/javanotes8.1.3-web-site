<h2>News for the Eighth Edition of This Book</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>August 1, 2021</b> &mdash; Version 8.1.3 is released, with updates to information
about Java versions and about Eclipse in Section&nbsp;2.6.  There are some other small
changes, including a few error corrections.</li>
<li><b>May 7, 2021</b> &mdash; The lab assignments from my Spring 2021 Introductory Programming
course, using Chapters 1 through 7 of this book, can be found at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/</a>.</li>
<li><b>December 29, 2020</b> &mdash; Version 8.1.2 is released.  This small update fixes
a few errors, adds very short introductions to two new Java features (text blocks and
records), and updates the information about programming environments in Section&nbsp;2.6.</li>
<li><b>May 19, 2020</b> &mdash; Version 8.1.1 is released.  This is a really tiny update,
released for the web and PDF versions of the book only.  The main motivation was a change
in the links to the print versions at lulu.com.  I also updated Section 2.6 to reflect the
fact that the current version of Java is Java&nbsp;14, and Subsection 3.6.5 to say that
the new <tt>switch</tt> statement syntax is now an official part of the language.</li>
<li><b>July 2, 2019</b> &mdash; Version 8.1 is released.  This is a minor update whose
main purpose is to make it clearer how to use the book with Java&nbsp;11 and JavaFX.
The major changes are in Section&nbsp;2.6.  
A few short topics from Java&nbsp;11 and Java&nbsp;12 have also been added.
The main web address for the book,
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes</a>, now
points to the eighth edition.</li>
<li><b>May 15, 2019</b> &mdash; The lab assignments from my Spring 2019 Intermediate Programming
course, using Chapters 8 through 13 of the eighth edition, can be found at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/</a>.</li>
<li><b>December 5, 2018</b> &mdash; The official release of the Eighth Edition.  Once again, I am
indebted to John Ganci, who contributed many corrections to the "beta" version of this edition.</li>
<li><b>August 19, 2018</b> &mdash; A "final beta" version of the Eighth Edition is available for
browsing on the web and for download.
The official release of the Eighth Edition will take place some time after Java 11 is released.</li>

<h2>Errata for Version 8.1</h2>

<p>This is a list of substantive errors that have been found in Version 8.1.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 2.5</b>: A reader wrote to point out some errors in the description of Java
expressions in Section 2.5.  The statement in Subsection 2.5.3 that said <code>x&nbsp;==&nbsp;Double.NaN</code>
and <code>x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;Double.NaN</code> are both <code>false</code> in all cases is not correct.
In fact, <code>x&nbsp;==&nbsp;Double.NaN</code> is defined to be false in all cases, and
<code>x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;Double.NaN</code> is defined to be <code>true</code> in all cases.
Also, Subsection 2.5.6 incorrectly said that there is an assignment operator <code>&amp;&amp;=</code>.
There is no such operator. [Fixed in version 8.1.2.] </li>
<li><b>Section 2.6</b>: Near the end of Subsection 2.6.3, a .bat file 
for compiling JavaFX programs on the command line in windows is given as <span class="error">javac -p&nbsp;C:\Users\eck\openjfx-sdk-11\lib --add-modules=ALL-MODULES-PATH&nbsp;$*</span>.
It should be <span class="fix">javac -p&nbsp;C:\Users\eck\openjfx-sdk-11\lib --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH&nbsp;%*</span>.
Note the use of&nbsp;% at the end instead of&nbsp;$, and the extra "S" that was added to ALL-MODULE-PATH in the incorrect
version.  [Fixed in version 8.1.3.]</li>
<li><b>Section 2.6</b>: In the last paragraph of Subsection 2.6.7,
"For example, if a program is in a package named <span class="error"><code>text.pkg</code></span>"
should be "For example, if a program is in a package named <span class="fix"><code>test.pkg</code></span>".
[Fixed in version 8.1.2.]</li>
<li><b>Source file RandomCircles.java for Chapter 3</b>: The comments on this file were not updated from
an earlier version and did not correctly describe the program.  [Comments are corrected in version 8.1.2.]</li>
<li><b>Section 4.4</b>: At the start of the sample program <i>ThreeN2</i> in Subsection 4.4.3,
<span class="error"><code>input&nbsp;textio.TextIO</code></span> should be
<span class="fix"><code>import&nbsp;textio.TextIO</code></span>.
[Fixed in version 8.1.2.]</li>
<li><b>Section 6.4</b>: The method <span class="error">control.setToolTipText(text)</span> for setting the
tool tip for a control is incorrect.  This is left over from the Swing GUI.  In JavaFX, a tool tip
can be set using <span class="fix">control.setTooltip(new&nbsp;Tooltip(string))</span>.
[Fixed in version 8.1.3.]</li>
<li><b>Section 7.5</b>: In the illustration of a symmetric matrix in Subsection 7.5.1, two of the
entries are not symmetric.  <span class="error"><code>M[0][3]</code></span> should be 6, not 13,
and <span class="error"><code>M[3][6]</code></span> should be -4, not&nbsp;4. [Fixed in version 8.1.2.]</li>
<li><b>Section 7.2</b>: In the next-to-last code segment in Subsection 7.2.1,
<span class="error"><code>double&nbsp;B</code></span> should be <span class="fix"><code>double[]&nbsp;B</code></span>.
[Corrected in Version 8.1.1.]</li>
<li><b>Section 10.1</b>: In several places, <span class="error">JFC</span> is used as the abbreviation for
the Java Collection Framework.  It should be <span class='fix'>JCF</span>.  [Fixed in version 8.1.3.]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Errata for Version 8.0</h2>

<p>This is a list of substantive errors that were found in the original Version&nbsp;8.0 from December 2018.
These errors have been corrected in Version&nbsp;8.1.</p>

<!-- <li><b></b>, <span class="error"></span> should be <span class="fix"></span></li> -->

<ul>
<li><b>Section 3.9, Section 1</b>: Three occurrences of <span class="error">g.drawLine</span>
should be <span class="fix">g.strokeLine</span></li>
<li><b>Chapter 6 Quiz Answers</b>, in the answer to Question 5, "<span class="error">The drawLine command</span>"
should be "<span class="fix">The strokeLine command</span>".
<li><b>Section 10.6</b>, next-to-last paragraph of the introductory material:
"The net result is that we've added up the lengths of all the
<span class="error">streams</span> in the list" should be 
"The net result is that we've added up the lengths of all the
<span class="fix">strings</span> in the list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Old News</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>November 25, 2017</b> -- My <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index.html">CPSC 124 web site</a>
includes programming assignments as well as tests and quizzes from the Fall 2017 of my Introductory
Programming course [using the seventh edition of this textbook].</li>
<li><b>March 19, 2016</b> -- I have added eBook versions of this textbook to the web site, in
"epub" format and in "mobi" format for Kindle.  They can be downloaded using links at the
bottom of the <a href="index.html">front&nbsp;page</a>.  Note that there can be problems with
the rendering of long lines in code samples, and that the problems will be worse on some
devices.  The eBook versions should be considered somewhat experimental.
In addition to adding the eBooks, a very small number
of errors (about a half dozen) have been fixed in the on-line and PDF versions, without
changing the version number.</li>
<li><b>August 1, 2014</b> -- Version 7 is released.  Version 7 requires Java&nbsp;7 or later.
Note that with this version, the book no longer cover applets, and there are no applets
in the on-line version.  Readers are encouraged to download, compile, and run the examples.
Links for downloading are available on the <a href="index.html">front&nbsp;page</a>.</li>
<li><b>May 17, 2013</b> -- Version 6.0.2 is released, with fixes for many small, mostly typographical
errors.  Again, thanks to readers who sent in error reports, especially Mark Christy and
John Ganci, who found many errors.</li>
<li><b>June 1, 2011</b> -- Version 6.0 is released.  The sixth edition adds a new
chapter on threads and multiprocessing and some coverage of new features of Java 6
and Java&nbsp;7.  Thanks to many readers who wrote with suggestions and error reports,
especially to Jeff Wexler who sent a large numbers of corrections.</li>
